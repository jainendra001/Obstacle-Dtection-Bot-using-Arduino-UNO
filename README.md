# Obstacle-Dtection-Bot-using-Arduino-UNO
This is an individual project alloted by our institute's(IIT Dhanbad) robotics clubs(ROBOISM). 
Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an intelligent device which can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning its
Supplies required:
Arduino UNO,BO Motors and Wheel,Jumper Cables,Wooden frame  For Chassis,18650 Battery And Holder,ULTRASONIC Sensor,Motor DriverServo Motor.
The basic principle behind the working of ultrasonic sensor is to note down the time taken by sensor to transmit ultrasonic beams and receiving the 
ultrasonic beams after hitting the surface. Then further the distance is calculated using the formula.In this project, the widely available HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
is used.
